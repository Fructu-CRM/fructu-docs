## Public API

The Fructu Public API allows premium CRM users to programmatically interact with their data. You can create and manage contacts, retrieve information, and automate actions directly from your own tools and applications.

Designed to be simple, secure, and high-performance, this public API gives you maximum flexibility to connect Fructu to your software ecosystem—whether through internal scripts, no-code tools, or automation platforms.

It is intended for developers and technical teams who want to extend Fructu’s capabilities and integrate it seamlessly into their existing workflows.

<Note>
  Access to the API is restricted to users with an active premium subscription.
