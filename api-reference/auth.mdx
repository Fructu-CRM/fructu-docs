## How do I authenticate to use the API?

All endpoints are secured using an API key associated with your Workspace.

Include your API key in the request header as shown in the example below:

```json
Authorization: Bearer {FRUCTU_API_KEY}
```
## Where can I find my API key?

Each Workspace has its own API key, which allows it to interact with the API.

You can find your API key in your Workspace settings, under the “API Key” tab.
